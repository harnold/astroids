Introduction
============

        ASTROIDS is a minimalistic remake of the classic arcade video game
        "Asteroids" by Atari.

        In this game, you are a space pilot for Galactic Sweeping, Inc.,
        the leading space cleaning company in the southern arm of the
        galaxy.  Your mission is to clean your assigned space area from
        as many asteroids as possible before finally getting destroyed.

        (As you can probably imagine, since no pilot ever manages to make
        it home and pick up his pay check, staff costs in this company are
        relatively low.  On the other hand, increasing costs for replacement
        space ships are a significant risk for the company's long-term
        profitability.)

        The standard cleaning ship is equipped with gravitonic deflector
        shields and a (somewhat antique) Class III pulsed phase cannon.
        Your shields are automatically activated when an asteroid hits your
        ship, but every activation consumes energy.  When all your energy
        is used up, then ...  well, you can imagine the consequences.
        Strangely enough, whenever you reach a multiple of 10000 points,
        your energy is fully recharged by some mysterious force.


How to play
===========

        After starting ASTROIDS, you are first asked to enter your name;
        then the title screen should appear.  By waiting for a few seconds,
        you can take a look at the Hall of Fame.  To read your own name
        there, press a key to start the game.

        In the game, the small blue/red can that appears at the center of
        the screen is your space ship.  The yellow bar in the top-left
        corner displays your remaining shield energy, and the number in the
        top-right corner displays your score.
